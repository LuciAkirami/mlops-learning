    "### Understanding How MLFlow saves Data\n",
    "\n",
    "MLFlow has two types of stores\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend Store**\n",
    "- In this store, MLFlow stores metadata information of experiments like parameters, metrics, tags etc\n",
    "- Bydefault this gets stored in the local filesystem under the name mlruns. In the mlruns file, you will have folder for each experiment. The folder name start with 0 (default experiment) for experiment 1 and if you have two experiments, you will have two folders 0 and 1, these 0 and 1 are experiment ids for the two experiments\n",
    "- Withing each of these folder you will have a meta.yaml file that contains info about where is the artifact location, the experiment_id, experiment name (for folder 0 experiment name is default) and such\n",
    "- For each run you create, a unique folder is created in that experiment folder(i.e. folder names with 0 , 1 ...) And inside this run folder, you will have the artifcats folder containing the model, parameters and all\n",
    "- We can also configure it to store in SQLAlchemy compatible DB (e.g. SQLite, Postgres)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artifacts Store**\n",
    "- Here MLFlow stores all the artifacts like the dataset used for training, the model itself and other configuration files like conda.yaml, requirements.txt that are needed to run the model\n",
    "- Again by default this is stored in the local filesystem\n",
    "- We can also configure it to store this information in remote location like Amazon S3 Bucket"

    "Model aliases and tags help you deploy and organize your models in the Model Registry.\n",

    "**Model Version**\n",
    "- Each registered model can have one or many versions. When a new model is added to the Model Registry, it is added as version 1. Each new model registered to the same model name increments the version number. Model versions have tags, which can be useful for tracking attributes of the model version (e.g. pre_deploy_checks: ‚ÄúPASSED‚Äù)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Alias**\n",
    "- Model aliases allow you to assign a mutable, named reference to a particular version of a registered model. By assigning an alias to a specific model version, you can use the alias to refer that model version via a model URI or the model registry API. For example, you can create an alias named champion that points to version 1 of a model named MyModel. You can then refer to version 1 of MyModel by using the URI models:/MyModel@champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aliases are especially useful for deploying models. For example, you could assign a champion alias to the model version intended for production traffic and target this alias in production workloads. You can then update the model serving production traffic by reassigning the champion alias to a different model version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tags**\n",
    "- Tags are key-value pairs that you associate with registered models and model versions, allowing you to label and categorize them by function or status. For example, you could apply a tag with key \"task\" and value \"question-answering\" (displayed in the UI as task:question-answering) to registered models intended for question answering tasks. At the model version level, you could tag versions undergoing pre-deployment validation with validation_status:pending and those cleared for deployment with validation_status:approved.\n",
